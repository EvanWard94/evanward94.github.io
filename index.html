    <h2>Problem of Study</h2>

    <p>The use of videos in higher education is a common multimedia teaching tool and is known to enhance studentsâ€™ understanding and learning of class materials (Berk, 2009; Mayor, 2001).
        Closed caption videos were developed to help students who are hearing impaired, and are also widely used to benefit English as a second language learners (Zamoon, 1996).
        While many of these platforms have been integrated in the classroom, both online and face to face, ELC, the primary online learning management system for the University of Georgia, lacks such a function.
        Our group has decided to study how effective closed-captioning is in helping students and how ELC can implement such a mechanic in order to improve the quality of life for the professors and
        the learning environment for the students.</p>


    <h2>Our Team</h2>

        <p>The Inclusive Dawgs are committed to our goal of closing the
        gap that exists in the accessibility for students with hearing impairments
        and those whose second language is English in English-speaking
        classrooms. Our team members are: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sarah Greene</li>
            <li>Evan Ward</li>

            <li>Christina Liberto</li>
        </ul>
