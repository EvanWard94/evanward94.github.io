    <h2>A. Task/Problem Definition</h2>
    <p>1. Introducing our problem: </p>
    <p>2. Identifying potential users: </p>
    <p class="responses">
        Potential users affected are instructors and students, but more specifically students with hearing disabilities and whose second language is English.
    </p>
    <h2>B. Analysis of Existing Solutions</h2>
    <p>1. Existing Solutions: </p>
    <p class="responses">
        Instructors are able to manually create closed captioning on videos posted in a course either themselves or through outsourcing. There are two ways to upload a video onto ELC. One way involves uploading directly from your computer and having the option to add subtitles using an SRT file. However, depending on the video, ELC may not support this type of video and only the audio will be visible. Another way to upload a video is through Kaltura. Kaltura has more support for different video types and allows for editing to add subtitles through an external file. Another way to add subtitles is through the request of machine captioning, which has an “accuracy rate of 70-80%” and takes about 30 minutes depending on the size of the file (Kaltura Documentation). Such solutions require additional time on the part of the instructor to ensure that the subtitles/transcripts are accurate and must plan ahead if they are to transcribe the video themselves. It typically takes 5-10 times the duration of the video just to add subtitles and transcribe it (Enamorado, Sofia). Instructors also have the option to upload their video to a third party platform that supplies auto-captioning and provide a link on ELC. For example, an instructor could create all video and audio content on Zoom, which has automatic closed-captioning built in, or upload their audio or video content to YouTube, which provides the option for automatic closed-captioning as well.

    <p>2. Describing Potential Guidelines and Solutions: </p>
    <h2>C. Proposed Solution</h2>
    <p>1. Our Solution Proposal: </p>
    <p class ="responses">The solution proposed is implementing an automatic closed-captioning/transcript function with 98%-100% accuracy within the ELC platform for instructor use upon uploading a file with audio or video. 
    </p>
    <p>2. How We Are Measuring Success: </p>
    <p class="responses">Success will be measured by instructor-uploaded videos being auto captioned, students having the captioning and transcript options in every video, and the captioning and transcript being able to accurately depict the audio from the video they are on.
