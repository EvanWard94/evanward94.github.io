    <h2> A. User Experience Requirements</h2>
    <h3> 1. Related User Stories</h3>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;Relevant to our problem as it relates to face-to-face instruction, there are several users that can be identified. While there are two main user groups, instructors and students, they can be broken down further into sub groups for the purpose of creating user stories. The groups selected are as follows: instructor users, student users with hearing impairments, student users whose first language is not English, and student users who speak primarily English and do not have hearing impairments. </p>

    <b>User Stories: Instructor Users</b>

     <h3> 2. Most Relevant User Stories</h3>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;Based on the user stories generated, a few can be selected as the most relevant per criteria discussed in Milestone 2. Justifications and evidence for each user story chosen are provided below.</p>

    <p>&emsp;&emsp;Closed-caption videos and transcripts were developed to help hearing impaired individuals, and are also widely used to benefit English as a second language learners (Zamoon, 1996). Closed-captions and transcripts are essential for students with hearing impairments and those who do not speak English as their first language in the classroom, as this enhances comprehension of the content being displayed (National Center for Biotechnology Information). Closed-captions and transcripts allow viewers who are deaf or hard-of-hearing to follow the dialogue and the action of a program simultaneously (National Institute of Deafness and Other Communication Disorders). Further, for students whose second language is English, studies have shown that closed-captions and transcripts benefit content recall, listening comprehension, and overall comprehension in general (National Center for Biotechnology Information). Thus, the following user stories were identified as the most relevant with regard to this justification: </p>
    <div class = "number2">
        <ol type = "1">
            <li>As a student with a hearing impairment, I want to view all audio and video content uploaded to ELC with the option to turn closed-captioning on. </li>
            <li>As a student with a hearing impairment, I want to view all audio and video content uploaded to ELC with the option to download a corresponding transcript.</li>
            <li>As a student whose first language is not English, I want closed captions on my instructors videos so that I can read some text while the instructor is speaking so that I can follow along more easily.</li>
            <li>As a student whose first language is not English, I want a transcript available to view so that I can just read the instruction rather than slowly follow along with a video and pause when I’m not sure what the instructor is saying.</li>

        </ol>
    </div>

    <p>&emsp;&emsp;Inadequate closed-captions and transcripts prove to be useless to a viewer, and can be placed in the same category as content that has no closed-captioning or transcripts whatsoever (National Association of the Deaf). Further, the industry standard for closed-captioning is 99% (fcc.gov). Accuracy of closed-captioning and transcripts is important to accurately reflect the content being relayed in audio and video content, most importantly for students with hearing impairments or those whose second language is English, but for all students as well. Thus, the following user stories were identified as the most relevant with regard to this justification: </p>
    <div class = "number2">
        <ol type = "1">
            <li>As a student with a hearing impairment, I hope that the closed-captioning on the audio and video content I am accessing on ELC has at least 99% accuracy so that I can understand the content being viewed with ease.</li>
            <li>As a student with a hearing impairment, I hope that the transcripts corresponding to any audio and video content have at least 99% accuracy so that I can understand the content being viewed with ease. </li>
            <li>As an English-speaking student without a hearing impairment, I want all captions and transcripts to be accurate, so that their purpose is not defeated through unintelligible or missing text.</li>
            <li>As an instructor, I want to add closed captioning with at least 99% accuracy so that students with hearing impairments or English not as their first language are able to understand what I am saying.</li>
            <li>As an instructor, I want to add transcripts with at least 99% accuracy so that students with hearing impairments or English not as their first language are able to understand what I am saying.</li>
            <li>As an instructor, my closed captioning should be flagged for potential inaccuracies so that the video’s closed captioning is at least 99% accurate.</li>
            <li>As an instructor, the transcripts should be flagged for any potential inaccuracies so that the video’s transcripts are at least 99% accurate.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    
      <p>&emsp;&emsp;According to Criterion 1.2.5, Audio Description (Pre-recorded) (Level AA) from the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, the software behind ELC, Desire2Learn (D2L), has a conformance level of ‘Not Supported’. ELC, then, lacks an integrated function to provide instructors with a means to produce closed-captions and transcripts, leaving instructors with the responsibility to acquire closed-captions and transcripts either through a manual process, or through the use of a third party. This affects students, in that they might have to access a separate platform than ELC to access closed-captions and transcripts, which might be inaccessible to them altogether. Thus, the following user stories were identified as the most relevant with regard to this justification:</p>
    <div class = "number2">
        <ol type = "1">
            <li>As a student with a hearing impairment, I want all closed-captioning on audio and video content to be accessed directly in ELC, so that I do not have to visit another platform to access this option.</li>
            <li>As a student with a hearing impairment, I want all transcripts corresponding to audio and video content to be accessed directly in ELC, so that I do not have to visit another platform to access this option. </li>
            <li>As an English-speaking student without a hearing impairment, I want all captions and transcripts to be accessible through ELC, so that I do not have to unnecessarily access another service.</li>
            <li>As an instructor, I hope to add closed-captioning to my video directly on ELC without any additional cost so that I will not have to outsource the video and spend extra money.</li>
            <li>As an instructor, I hope to add transcripts to my video directly on ELC without any additional cost so that I will not have to outsource the video and spend extra money.</li>

    <h2> B. Ideation and Preliminary Designs</h2>
    <h3> 1. Ideation</h3>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;Based on the user stories identified and justified, numerous ideas for alternative design solutions were generated. The Inclusive Dawgs took part in three separate ideation sessions in order to generate all possible ways to address each user story. The three ideation sessions are depicted below. </p>

        <h2> C. Detailed Designs</h2>

    <b class = "center1">Detailed Design #1</b>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;Detailed design number one represents the best design alternative between wireframe 1 and wireframe 2.</p>
    <br><br>
    <iframe style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" class = "center" width="800" height="450" src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Ffile%2FW5y2pnncUjb30LLTnomVW4%2FDetailed-Design-Instructor-From-Wireframe-%25231%3Fnode-id%3D0%253A1" allowfullscreen></iframe>

    <br><br>
    <b class = "center1">Justification</b>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;This is the best detailed design from the wireframe alternatives because having a button that explicitly states “Checking Inaccuracies” versus just a picture of a flag as the button is a clear indicator of what needs to be done to ensure that the “Upload” button becomes available for use. Although the flag image draws attention, it is not clear to the user that it should be clicked on to check for inaccuracies.</p>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;Having the video be flagged if the accuracy of the closed captioning and transcripts are less than 99%, ensures that the instructor checks for these inaccuracies so that it is at least 99% accurate and the video can not be uploaded unless they are checked. It is important that these inaccuracies are checked because according to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), “ to understand a program’s content, accurate captions also convey the manner and tone of the speaker’s voice” and are needed to understand the speaker’s message.</p>
    <br><br>
    <b class = "center1">Detailed Design #2</b>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;Detailed design number two represents the best design alternative between wireframe 3 and wireframe 4.</p>

    <br><br>
    <b class = "center1">Justification</b>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;This is the best detailed design from the wireframe alternatives that were created because the accuracy completion percentage is represented through text at the bottom of the screen and as a result, this is difficult to view visually compared to the progress bar that is used in the other wireframe and in the detailed design. According to Adobe, it is important to “use contrast to make an element stand out”, which in this case is the green filled progress bar. The green filled progress bar provides a visual with more contrast to draw the user’s attention, in comparison to simple black text. (https://xd.adobe.com/ideas/principles/web-design/role-visual-design-user-experience/)</p>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp; A green progress bar indicates the completion of the closed captioning and transcripts attached to the video being uploaded. The upload button is greyed out and disabled until the closed captioning and transcripts are completely added to the video and once it is added, the upload button turns green. This now allows for the instructor to upload the video. Making the addition of transcripts and closed captioning to the videos mandatory, it benefits those who have hearing impairments and whose first language is not English (Zamoon, 1996). These additions not only benefit those with hearing impairments or whose first language is not English but also “benefits children, college students, and adults who don’t have hearing impairment or limited English skills in their comprehension and memorization of video contents via increased attention” (Gernsbacher, 2015).</p>
    <br><br>
    <b class = "center1">Detailed Design #3</b>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;Detailed design number three represents the best design alternative between wireframe 5 and wireframe 6.</p>

    <p>&emsp;&emsp;This is the best detailed design from the wireframe alternatives that were created for editing captions, as it combines the interfaces for viewing and editing captions, reviewing inaccuracies, and moving captions around on the timeline. As such, the instructor is presented with a single, simplified interface to access all functions.</p>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;The video is displayed on the editing page for easy previewing. The captions are listed out vertically, allowing the user to quickly scan through and find the one they are looking for. The blue marks on the video timeline represent caption locations, and the user can easily drag and drop them to rearrange captions and sync them perfectly with the video.</p>

    <b class = "center1">Justification</b>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;This is the best detailed design from the wireframe alternatives that were created for accessing audio and video content transcripts, as the transcript corresponding to the content being accessed appears right under the content in the same window. Such a design allows for more ease of use in regard to following along with content being displayed and transcripts can either be shown or hidden depending on a user's needs. Additionally, this design removes any requirement of a student user having to go to a different window, a new webpage, or access a downloaded file on their computer, as the transcripts requested are shown within the ELC platform. This design allows for reduced time to access the requested transcripts, and the transcript and video or audio content can be read and played in unison as a result.</p>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;A button is displayed immediately under the video (in this case, but it could be audio content as well), signifying that the transcript is available and can be shown. The down arrow on the button signifies that the transcript will be displayed directly under the video, rather than having to first download the transcript and then navigate to where it can be opened. Once the button is pressed, it changes to 'Hide Transcript' with an up arrow, which signifies that the transcript can be removed from the display if desired. Additionally, the transcript appears below the video, including time stamps, and remains in the window until 'Hide Transcript' is selected.</p>
