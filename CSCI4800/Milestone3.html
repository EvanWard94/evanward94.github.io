    <h2> A. User Experience Requirements</h2>
    <h3> 1. Related User Stories</h3>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;Relevant to our problem as it relates to face-to-face instruction, there are several users that can be identified. While there are two main user groups, instructors and students, they can be broken down further into sub groups for the purpose of creating user stories. The groups selected are as follows: instructor users, student users with hearing impairments, student users whose first language is not English, and student users who speak primarily English and do not have hearing impairments. </p>

        <ol type = "1">

            <li>As a student whose first language is not English, I want a transcript of the words my instructor says in a video available so that if there is a word or sentence I may not understand I can copy and paste it to a translation app rather than try to find someone else to translate it for me.</li>
            <li>As a student whose first language is not English, I want a transcript of the video my professor posted with the ability to translate it to my native language so that I can read the instruction in a language familiar to me and better understand it.</li>
