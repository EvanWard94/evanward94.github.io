   <h2>A. High-Fidelity Prototype</h2>
    <h3>1. High-Fidelity Prototypes</h3>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;Prototypes are proven to be useful in allowing users to experience content and interactions within the proposed interface. To mimic the functionality of the ELC platform integrated with both a method by which to automatically upload audio and video content with adequate closed captions and transcriptions, and to access adequate closed captions and transcriptions on all audio and video content being accessed in ELC, high-fidelity prototypes were created for the two key stakeholders: instructors and students.</p>

    <p>&emsp;&emsp;It is important to note that visual content was taken directly from ELC for integration within each prototype. Use of such content constitutes fair use, and the Inclusive Dawgs' fair use statement can be accessed using the navigation bar at the top of this website, or through the following link: <a href = "FairUse.html">Fair Use Notice</a></p>

    <h2>B. Testing Protocol</h2>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;As the proposed problem involves two key stakeholders, instructors and students, separate testing will be conducted for each stakeholder group.</p>
    <h3>1. Research Question, Testing Protocol & Testing Procedure</h3>
    <br>
    <b class = "center1">Instructor Side</b>
    <br>
    <b>Research Question:</b>
    <p>Does the inclusion of an automatic transcription and closed-captioning software embedded in the ELC platform reduce the time and money constraints placed on instructors, and increase overall ease of use?</p>
    <br>
    <b>Methodology:</b>
    <br>
    <b class = "center1">Student Side</b>
    <br>
    <b>Research Question:</b>
    <p>Does the inclusion of accurate closed-captions and transcriptions on all audio and video content available directly in the ELC platform increase user comprehension of course material for students with hearing impairments, whose second language is English, and who have no hearing impairments and whose first language is English?</p>
    <br>
    <b>Methodology:</b>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;Both the observation and survey methodologies will be used to test the proposed research question. Observational research proves to be useful in situations where the goal is to evaluate an ongoing behavior process, event, or situation, or when there are physical, quantifiable outcomes that can readily be seen (Channelplay Limited, 2020)
        The research question proposed involves a study of user comprehension, which requires the evaluation of students’ performance over the course of a given time frame. In order to determine if user comprehension increases with the presence of adequate closed captions and transcripts, or decreases when adequate closed captions and transcripts are unavailable, performance must be evaluated to determine the outcomes, and thus the participant observation method was chosen. Further, outside of a student’s performance, we want to determine if individuals themselves find that closed captions and transcripts lead to a better understanding of course material. Thus, the survey methodology was chosen as well.</p>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;Survey research is used to “answer questions that have been raised, to solve problems that have been posed or observed, to assess needs and set goals, to determine whether or not specific objectives have been met, to establish baselines against which future comparisons can be made, to analyze trends across time, and generally, to describe what exists, in what amount, and in what context” (Isaac & Michael, 1997, p. 136). In order to determine if the objective of increased comprehension has been met through the inclusion of automatic, adequate closed captions and transcripts, a survey will be used to determine such from the perspective of the user, outside of their performance in a certain course over the given time frame. Additionally, we will employ the use of a survey to obtain study participants prior to the experiment’s commencement.</p>
    <br>
    <b>Testing Procedure:</b>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;Prior to the conduction of this experiment, a pre-experiment self-disclosure survey will be sent to the University of Georgia undergraduate student population. The purpose of this survey is to obtain data in regard to the study participants, as we want to group individuals into three categories. This survey will allow data to be gathered for further categorization of participants. Questions included in this survey will be as followed:</p>
    <div class = "signifiers">
        <ul>
            <li>Do you have medically diagnosed hearing loss, or require the assistance of hearing technology for day to day function? (Yes/No)</li>
            <li>Is English your first language? (Yes/No)</li>
            <li>The purpose of this study is to test user comprehension of course material as it relates to the presence or absence of adequate, automatic closed captions and transcripts. It will require enrollment in an additional course, which will demand at most an hour each week to complete. Additionally, you will be asked to take a survey at the conclusion of the study. Do you consent to participation in this study if chosen? (Yes/No)</li>
        </ul>
        </div>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;With the inclusion of a pre-experiment self-disclosure survey, information in regard to the participant population can be determined, as well as informed consent can be obtained, as only students who answer ‘Yes’ will be considered for participation in the study. Further, the survey will allow us, as researchers, to place participants into three categories: students with hearing impairments, students whose first language is not English, and students who do not have hearing impairments and whose first language is English.</p>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;One hundred students from each category will be randomly selected from those students who indicated they wish to participate in the study, for a sample-size of three hundred individuals. Each student will be placed into a further subset, also at random: access to automatic, adequate closed captions and transcripts, and automatic, adequate closed captions and transcripts that are inaccessible to students. Fifty students from each category will be placed into each subset, for a total of one hundred fifty students who have access to adequate, automatic closed-captions and transcripts, and one hundred fifty students who do not have access to adequate, automatic closed-captions.</p>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;This experiment will be conducted over the course of a semester, so as to obtain information in regard to performance from a five-month interval.</p>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;Students will be required to enroll in a generic course presented on the ELC platform, specifically curated for this experiment, in which they will be asked to watch videos related to the study and subsequently take quizzes on the material presented in such videos. A numerical grade will be assigned to each quiz taken, so as to be used as a quantifiable determinant of performance. At the conclusion of the semester, students will be administered a post-study survey, and in combination with the students’ grades on each quiz and students' responses to the survey, data will be gathered in order for further analysis to take place.</p>
    <br>
    <b>How will the results be analyzed?</b>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;The grades of students in each subset, those who had access to closed captions and transcripts and those that did not, will be compared to determine if performance in the course increased with use of adequate, automatic closed captions and transcripts. The following will be addressed in the comparisons:</p>
    <div class = "signifiers">
        <ul>
            <li>Were grades in the course higher among students who had access to adequate, automatic closed captions? </li>
            <li>If high grades were achieved among students who did not have access to adequate, automatic closed captions, which category did they fall under?</li>
            <li>If lower grades were achieved among students who had access to adequate, automatic closed captions, which category did they fall under?</li>
        </ul>
        </div>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;The grades of each student, the category they fall under, and the subset they belonged to will all be graphed to visualize the results, and allow for ease of comprehension. The mean grade for the course will be calculated by adding each students’ overall grade, and dividing by the number of participants. Students whose grade falls above the mean will be considered to have achieved high performance in the course, and students whose grade falls below the mean will be considered in the category of low performance. The number of students with high performance from each subset will be summed, and the number of students with low performance from each subset will be summed. Further, the number of high performing students in each category will be summed to create an overall breakdown as follows:</p>
    <div class = "signifiers">
        <ul>
            <li>Sum of students with hearing impairments that had access to adequate, automatic closed captions and transcripts who were high performers</li>
            <li>Sum of students whose first language is not English that had access to adequate, automatic closed captions and transcripts who were high performers</li>
            <li>Sum of students who had no hearing impairments and whose first language is English that had access to adequate, automatic closed captions and transcripts who were high performers</li>
            <li>Sum of students with hearing impairments that had access to adequate, automatic closed captions and transcripts who were low performers</li>
            <li>Sum of students whose first language is not English that had access to adequate, automatic closed captions and transcripts who were low performers</li>
            <li>Sum of students who had no hearing impairments and whose first language is English that had access to adequate, automatic closed captions and transcripts who were low performers</li>
            <li>Sum of students with hearing impairments that didn’t have access to adequate, automatic closed captions and transcripts who were high performers</li>
            <li>Sum of students whose first language is not English that didn’t have access to adequate, automatic closed captions and transcripts who were high performers</li>
            <li>Sum of students who had no hearing impairments and whose first language is English that didn’t have access to adequate, automatic closed captions and transcripts who were high performers</li>
            <li>Sum of students with hearing impairments that didn’t have access to adequate, automatic closed captions and transcripts who were low performers</li>
            <li>Sum of students whose first language is not English that didn’t have access to adequate, automatic closed captions and transcripts who were low performers</li>
            <li>Sum of students who had no hearing impairments and whose first language is English that didn’t have access to adequate, automatic closed captions and transcripts who were low performers</li>
        </ul>
        </div>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;We can then obtain the average number of students who were high performers who had access to closed captions and transcripts, and compare the average to those students who didn’t have access to closed captions and transcripts and were high performers.</p>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;In studying the performance of students over the course of a semester, and comparing the performance of students with and without access to adequate, automatic closed captions and transcripts, the research question can be answered as to whether or not student comprehension of course material increases with access to adequate, automatic closed captions and transcripts.</p>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;Following the observation component of the study’s conclusion, all three hundred study participants will be administered a survey to complete in regard to their evaluation of personal performance as it relates to the presence or absence of adequate, automatic closed captions and transcripts. The purpose of the survey is to eliminate discrepancies that might exist in the observation data as it relates to a student’s handling of their coursework. Students will evaluate their performance, and answer questions designed to obtain data in regard to if they believe their performance in the course was enhanced or at a disadvantage with the presence or absence of adequate, automatic closed captions and transcripts. From this data, comparisons can be made again between students who had access to adequate, automatic closed captions and transcripts and those who did not. The percentage of students who cite that they believe their performance was enhanced with closed captions and transcripts versus the percentage of students who cite that their performance decreased with a lack of closed captions and transcripts can be compared and graphed in a similar way to the observation data.</p>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;Both the observation and survey method can be conducted safely during a pandemic, as there is little to no interaction between study participants, or between study participants and researchers. Both observation and survey can, and will be conducted remotely and online using the ELC platform and the University of Georgia’s Qualtrics survey platform.</p>
