    <h2>A. High-Fidelity Prototype</h2>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;Prototypes are proven to be useful in allowing users to experience content and interactions within the proposed interface. To mimic the functionality of the ELC platform integrated with both a method by which to automatically upload audio and video content with adequate closed captions and transcriptions, and to access adequate closed captions and transcriptions on all audio and video content being accessed in ELC, high-fidelity prototypes were created for the two key stakeholders: instructors and students.</p>

    <p>&emsp;&emsp;It is important to note that visual content was taken directly from ELC for integration within each prototype. Use of such content constitutes fair use, and the Inclusive Dawgs' fair use statement can be accessed using the navigation bar at the top of this website, or through the following link: <a href = "FairUse.html">Fair Use Notice</a></p>

    <p>&emsp;&emsp;The high-fidelity prototypes, including the relevant user-stories, an extended description that discusses how each prototype and the chosen design components address the problem of study, and a demo video can be found below.</p>

    <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The user stories addressed in both high-fidelity prototypes 1A and 1B are as follows:</p>
    <div class = "number2">
        <ol type = "1">
            <li>As an instructor, the closed captioning and transcripts should be flagged for potential inaccuracies so that the video’s closed captioning and transcripts each have at least a 99% accuracy rate.</li>
            <li>As an instructor, I want to add both closed captioning and transcripts with my video so that students with hearing impairments or English not as their first language are able to understand what I am saying.</li>
            <li>As a student with a hearing impairment, I hope that the closed-captioning on the audio and video content I am accessing on ELC has at least 99% accuracy so that I can understand the content being viewed with ease.</li>
            <li>As a student with a hearing impairment, I hope that the transcripts corresponding to any audio and video content have at least 99% accuracy so that I can understand the content being viewed with ease.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <b>Detailed Description:</b>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;The design elements allow for the completion of these user stories. By showing a greyed out ‘Upload’ button after the video is uploaded and a red button to check inaccuracies indicates that the video cannot be uploaded until the closed captioning and transcripts have at least 99% accuracy. The red color was chosen for this element to check inaccuracies because the color red indicates importance and warning in Western cultures (UX planet). After clicking on the ‘Check Inaccuracies’ button and fixing any errors, the accuracy of the closed captioning and transcriptions are re-evaluated and if it’s at least 99% then the ‘Upload’ button turns green. By having it turn green, it provides an indication that the visual content satisfies these user stories dealing with accuracy rate and can be uploaded. The color green was used for this ‘Upload’ element because in Western cultures, the color green symbolizes a success status (UX planet). Our hope is that by having the software embedded into ELC’s upload option that automatically adds closed captioning and transcriptions, it will reduce the amount of effort needed to add closed captioning or manually add transcripts on the instructor’s own time.</p>

    <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The user stories addressed in this high-fidelity prototype are as follows:</p>
    <div class = "number2">
        <ol type = "1">
          <li>As a student with a hearing impairment, I want to view all audio and video content uploaded to ELC with the option to turn closed-captioning on.</li>
            <li>As a student whose first language is not English I want closed captions on my instructors videos so that I can read some text while the instructor is speaking and follow along more easily.</li>

        </ol>
        </div>
    <b>Detailed Description:</b>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;The design elements allow for students with hearing impairments, whose first language is not English, and an English speaking student without a hearing impairment to view closed captioning and transcripts. The inclusion of both closed captions and transcripts, as indicated by the ‘CC’ button located on the content’s window and the ‘Show Transcript’ button, addresses all user stories involved in the high-fidelity prototype. Further, by including a closed captioning symbol (‘CC’) and a ‘Show Transcript’ button on the same page as the visual content, it provides a clear indicator that these options are provided to them. Having the closed captioning appear at the bottom of the video screen provides a way for a student to read what the audio in the video is speaking about. Having the transcripts appear below the video when the ‘Show transcript’ is clicked allows for an easy condensed visual of everything that is said within the video in one location. When the closed captioning symbol is selected by a user, the words will appear at the bottom of the content window in time with the audio content associated with the video. When the ‘Show Transcript’ button is selected, it will display the video’s transcript below the video content window. With the inclusion of both buttons, and subsequently displaying closed captions and transcripts upon their selection, all user stories are addressed, as the option to view closed captions and transcripts exists in the presence of these elements of the prototype.</p>

    <h2>B. Testing Protocol</h2>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;As the proposed problem involves two key stakeholders, instructors and students, separate testing will be conducted for each stakeholder group.</p>
    <br>
    <b class = "center1">Instructor Side</b>
    <br>
    <b>Research Question:</b>
    <p>Does the inclusion of an automatic transcription and closed-captioning software embedded in the ELC platform reduce the time and money constraints placed on instructors, and increase overall ease of use?</p>
    <br>
    <b>Methodology:</b>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp; Both the survey and focus group methodologies will be used to test the proposed research question. Survey research is defined as “the collection of information from a sample of individuals through their responses to questions. Because we want to obtain information in regard to participants’ feelings towards the implementation of an automatic transcription and closed captioning function within ELC, the survey method will allow for relevant questions to be asked and participants to answer questions as relevant to their feelings towards using the platform. Use of the survey method will also allow for the same questions to be asked to all study participants, so as to extract information from the participants for further analysis to take place.</p>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;The focus group methodology is frequently used as a “qualitative approach to gain an in-depth understanding of social issues” (British Ecological Society, 2018). This method aims to “obtain data from a purposely selected group of individuals rather than from a statistically representative sample of a population” (British Ecological Society, 2018). Because the research focuses solely on the perspective of instructors, a focus group will allow for a better understanding of an instructor’s interaction with the automatic closed captioning and transcription software implemented in the ELC platform, and further, to identify their thought process during use. Focus groups will also prove to be useful in determining future updates to the ELC platform that can further enhance an instructor’s experience, and more effectively address any problems that might exist in the platform’s additions.</p>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;Two hundred instructors will be randomly selected from the group of respondents who answered 'Yes' to both questions, so as to include participants that teach a variety of subjects.</p>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;All two hundred participants will be asked to utilize the new, automatic transcription and closed-captioning system. Instructors will be required to create a generic course presented on the ELC platform, in which they will be asked to create two instructional videos on any topic, and subsequently add closed-captions and transcriptions to their video.</p>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;The first video instructors close caption and transcribe will be completed using the old, manual system that is currently integrated in the ELC platform. The second video instructors close caption and transcribe will be completed utilizing the new automatic closed-caption and transcription system.</p>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;After closed-captioning and transcribing each video, both after using the old, manual system and the new, automatic system, instructors will be administered a brief survey reviewing their experience closed-captioning and transcribing each video. The survey will include the following questions:</p>
    <div class = "signifiers">
        <ul>
            <li>In terms of hours and minutes, how long did it take to finish captioning and transcribing the video? (Enter a numerical value in the format: hour, minutes)</li>
            <li>On a scale of 1 to 5, 1 being very hard and 5 being very easy, how difficult was it to add captions and transcriptions?</li>
            <li>Did you outsource or require outside assistance to create the captions and transcriptions? (Yes/No)</li>
        </ul>
        </div>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;At the conclusion of the survey component of the study, all participants will be randomly placed in a focus group. There will be twenty different groups, each consisting of ten instructors, all of which will be asked the same feedback questions for further discussion to take place. The responses to these questions will be utilized for potentially tweaking and improving the caption system after the experiment has completed. The focus group will include the following questions:</p>
    <div class = "signifiers">
        <ul>
            <li>Do you think the new automatic system relieved the need for outsourcing captions and transcriptions?</li>
            <li>Was the new system more time-efficient in comparison to the old captioning and transcription system?</li>
            <li>What disadvantages, if any, were there to the new system?</li>
            <li>How would you rate the accuracy of the automatic captions and transcriptions?</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <br>
    <b>How will the results be analyzed?</b>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;The responses of instructors in each subset, completing captioning and transcription with access to the new automatic system and without access, will be compared to determine if time and money usage decreased when utilizing the new system.. The following will be addressed in the comparisons:</p>
    <div class = "signifiers">
        <ul>
            <li>On average, did instructors using the new automatic system spend less time adding captions?</li>
            <li>Did instructors find the new system to be easier to work with than the previous manual system?</li>
            <li>Did the new system lead to a reduced need for outsourcing captions to a third party, and thereby a reduced monetary impact?</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;Because we want to determine if there is a decrease in the time and money constraints placed on instructors, we can compare the responses of participants numerically from the responses of the survey after completing the first video with the responses after completing the second video.</p>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;The average time taken to close-caption and transcribe the first video, using the old, manual system can be obtained by summing the responses of all instructors from the first survey, and dividing by the sample size. Then, we can determine the average time taken to close-caption and transcribe the second video, using the new, automatic system, by summing the responses of all instructors from the second survey, and dividing by the sample size. The average time taken in the first and second video can be compared to determine if the amount of time taken to close-caption and transcribe a video decreases with the implementation of the new, automatic system.</p>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;Further, we can determine the mode of responses for the question referring to difficulty on a scale of one to five. The mode can be determined from the first survey, correlating to close-captioning and transcribing the video using the old, manual system, by finding which number (1, 2, 3, 4, or 5) appears the most within the dataset of responses. We can then determine the mode for the second survey, correlating to close-captioning and transcribing the video using the new, automatic system, in a similar fashion. We can then compare the modes of both datasets, so as to determine if more participants found a greater ease of use with the new, automatic system to close-caption and transcribe their videos.</p>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;Finally, we can look to the responses from the question referring to requiring additional assistance to close-caption and transcribe the videos. We can obtain the percentages of participants who required outside assistance to close-caption and transcribe the videos in each subset. To do so, we will sum the ‘Yes’ responses from the first survey, correlating to close-captioning and transcribing the video using the old, manual system, and divide the sum by the sample size and subsequently multiply by one hundred. Then, we will do the same for the second survey, correlating to close-captioning and transcribing the video using the new, automatic system. The percent of respondents who required outside assistance in each subset can then be compared to determine if the new, automatic system reduces the need for outsourcing when referring to the creation of closed-captions and transcriptions on audio and video content being uploaded to ELC.</p>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;While no numerical data will be obtained from focus group discussion, comparisons can be performed on the participants’ responses to the questions administered to each focus group. We can gain insight into the participants’ thought processes, as well as their overall attitude towards the new, automatic system. It can be determined through comparison of responses if there were common feelings among all participants towards the new, automatic system, and further, if there were common themes of reduced cost, time, and stress. The transcriptions produced by the focus group discussion can be placed in a spreadsheet, and comments made by each participant can be categorized by theme to determine the one that was most common. Additionally, we can group comments made into two categories: positive and negative, so as to determine any pitfalls that might exist in the new, automatic system. Through determining what the common themes among all comments were, and categorizing by positive and negative comments, we can more effectively determine if the new, automatic system eases time and money constraints, and further, if there are further modifications that need to be made prior to the final implementation of the new system.</p>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;Both the survey and focus groups methodologies can be conducted safely during a pandemic, as there is little to no interaction between study participants, or between study participants and researchers. Both survey and focus groups can, and will be conducted remotely and online using the ELC platform, the University of Georgia’s Qualtrics survey platform, and using the Zoom technology for all focus group discussion.</p>
    <br>
    <b class = "center1">Student Side</b>
    <br>
    <b>Research Question:</b>
    <p>Does the inclusion of accurate closed-captions and transcriptions on all audio and video content available directly in the ELC platform increase user comprehension of course material for students with hearing impairments, whose second language is English, and who have no hearing impairments and whose first language is English?</p>
    <br>
    <b>Methodology:</b>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;Both the observation and survey methodologies will be used to test the proposed research question. Observational research proves to be useful in situations where the goal is to evaluate an ongoing behavior process, event, or situation, or when there are physical, quantifiable outcomes that can readily be seen (Channelplay Limited, 2020)
        The research question proposed involves a study of user comprehension, which requires the evaluation of students’ performance over the course of a given time frame. In order to determine if user comprehension increases with the presence of adequate closed captions and transcripts, or decreases when adequate closed captions and transcripts are unavailable, performance must be evaluated to determine the outcomes, and thus the participant observation method was chosen. Further, outside of a student’s performance, we want to determine if individuals themselves find that closed captions and transcripts lead to a better understanding of course material. Thus, the survey methodology was chosen as well.</p>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;Survey research is used to “answer questions that have been raised, to solve problems that have been posed or observed, to assess needs and set goals, to determine whether or not specific objectives have been met, to establish baselines against which future comparisons can be made, to analyze trends across time, and generally, to describe what exists, in what amount, and in what context” (Isaac & Michael, 1997, p. 136). In order to determine if the objective of increased comprehension has been met through the inclusion of automatic, adequate closed captions and transcripts, a survey will be used to determine such from the perspective of the user, outside of their performance in a certain course over the given time frame. Additionally, we will employ the use of a survey to obtain study participants prior to the experiment’s commencement.</p>
    <br>
    <b>Testing Procedure:</b>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;Prior to the conduction of this experiment, a pre-experiment self-disclosure survey will be sent to the University of Georgia undergraduate student population. The purpose of this survey is to obtain data in regard to the study participants, as we want to group individuals into three categories. This survey will allow data to be gathered for further categorization of participants. Questions included in this survey will be as followed:</p>
    <div class = "signifiers">
        <ul>
            <li>Do you have medically diagnosed hearing loss, or require the assistance of hearing technology for day to day function? (Yes/No)</li>
            <li>Is English your first language? (Yes/No)</li>
            <li>The purpose of this study is to test user comprehension of course material as it relates to the presence or absence of adequate, automatic closed captions and transcripts. It will require enrollment in an additional course, which will demand at most an hour each week to complete. Additionally, you will be asked to take a survey at the conclusion of the study. Do you consent to participation in this study if chosen? (Yes/No)</li>
        </ul>
        </div>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;With the inclusion of a pre-experiment self-disclosure survey, information in regard to the participant population can be determined, as well as informed consent can be obtained, as only students who answer ‘Yes’ will be considered for participation in the study. Further, the survey will allow us, as researchers, to place participants into three categories: students with hearing impairments, students whose first language is not English, and students who do not have hearing impairments and whose first language is English.</p>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;One hundred students from each category will be randomly selected from those students who indicated they wish to participate in the study, for a sample-size of three hundred individuals. Each student will be placed into a further subset, also at random: access to automatic, adequate closed captions and transcripts, and automatic, adequate closed captions and transcripts that are inaccessible to students. Fifty students from each category will be placed into each subset, for a total of one hundred fifty students who have access to adequate, automatic closed-captions and transcripts, and one hundred fifty students who do not have access to adequate, automatic closed-captions.</p>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;This experiment will be conducted over the course of a semester, so as to obtain information in regard to performance from a five-month interval.</p>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;Students will be required to enroll in a generic course presented on the ELC platform, specifically curated for this experiment, in which they will be asked to watch videos related to the study and subsequently take quizzes on the material presented in such videos. A numerical grade will be assigned to each quiz taken, so as to be used as a quantifiable determinant of performance. At the conclusion of the semester, students will be administered a post-study survey, and in combination with the students’ grades on each quiz and students' responses to the survey, data will be gathered in order for further analysis to take place.</p>
    <br>
    <b>How will the results be analyzed?</b>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;The grades of students in each subset, those who had access to closed captions and transcripts and those that did not, will be compared to determine if performance in the course increased with use of adequate, automatic closed captions and transcripts. The following will be addressed in the comparisons:</p>
    <div class = "signifiers">
        <ul>
            <li>Were grades in the course higher among students who had access to adequate, automatic closed captions? </li>
            <li>If high grades were achieved among students who did not have access to adequate, automatic closed captions, which category did they fall under?</li>
            <li>If lower grades were achieved among students who had access to adequate, automatic closed captions, which category did they fall under?</li>
        </ul>
        </div>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;The grades of each student, the category they fall under, and the subset they belonged to will all be graphed to visualize the results, and allow for ease of comprehension. The mean grade for the course will be calculated by adding each students’ overall grade, and dividing by the number of participants. Students whose grade falls above the mean will be considered to have achieved high performance in the course, and students whose grade falls below the mean will be considered in the category of low performance. The number of students with high performance from each subset will be summed, and the number of students with low performance from each subset will be summed. Further, the number of high performing students in each category will be summed to create an overall breakdown as follows:</p>
    <div class = "signifiers">
        <ul>
            <li>Sum of students with hearing impairments that had access to adequate, automatic closed captions and transcripts who were high performers</li>
            <li>Sum of students whose first language is not English that had access to adequate, automatic closed captions and transcripts who were high performers</li>
            <li>Sum of students who had no hearing impairments and whose first language is English that had access to adequate, automatic closed captions and transcripts who were high performers</li>
            <li>Sum of students with hearing impairments that had access to adequate, automatic closed captions and transcripts who were low performers</li>
            <li>Sum of students whose first language is not English that had access to adequate, automatic closed captions and transcripts who were low performers</li>
            <li>Sum of students who had no hearing impairments and whose first language is English that had access to adequate, automatic closed captions and transcripts who were low performers</li>
            <li>Sum of students with hearing impairments that didn’t have access to adequate, automatic closed captions and transcripts who were high performers</li>
            <li>Sum of students whose first language is not English that didn’t have access to adequate, automatic closed captions and transcripts who were high performers</li>
            <li>Sum of students who had no hearing impairments and whose first language is English that didn’t have access to adequate, automatic closed captions and transcripts who were high performers</li>
            <li>Sum of students with hearing impairments that didn’t have access to adequate, automatic closed captions and transcripts who were low performers</li>
            <li>Sum of students whose first language is not English that didn’t have access to adequate, automatic closed captions and transcripts who were low performers</li>
            <li>Sum of students who had no hearing impairments and whose first language is English that didn’t have access to adequate, automatic closed captions and transcripts who were low performers</li>
        </ul>
        </div>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;We can then obtain the average number of students who were high performers who had access to closed captions and transcripts, and compare the average to those students who didn’t have access to closed captions and transcripts and were high performers.</p>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;In studying the performance of students over the course of a semester, and comparing the performance of students with and without access to adequate, automatic closed captions and transcripts, the research question can be answered as to whether or not student comprehension of course material increases with access to adequate, automatic closed captions and transcripts.</p>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;Following the observation component of the study’s conclusion, all three hundred study participants will be administered a survey to complete in regard to their evaluation of personal performance as it relates to the presence or absence of adequate, automatic closed captions and transcripts. The purpose of the survey is to eliminate discrepancies that might exist in the observation data as it relates to a student’s handling of their coursework. Students will evaluate their performance, and answer questions designed to obtain data in regard to if they believe their performance in the course was enhanced or at a disadvantage with the presence or absence of adequate, automatic closed captions and transcripts. From this data, comparisons can be made again between students who had access to adequate, automatic closed captions and transcripts and those who did not. The percentage of students who cite that they believe their performance was enhanced with closed captions and transcripts versus the percentage of students who cite that their performance decreased with a lack of closed captions and transcripts can be compared and graphed in a similar way to the observation data.</p>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;Both the observation and survey method can be conducted safely during a pandemic, as there is little to no interaction between study participants, or between study participants and researchers. Both observation and survey can, and will be conducted remotely and online using the ELC platform and the University of Georgia’s Qualtrics survey platform.</p>
