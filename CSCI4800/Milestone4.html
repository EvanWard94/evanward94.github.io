    <h2>A. High-Fidelity Prototype</h2>
    <h3>1. High-Fidelity Prototypes</h3>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;Prototypes are proven to be useful in allowing users to experience content and interactions within the proposed interface. To mimic the functionality of the ELC platform integrated with both a method by which to automatically upload audio and video content with adequate closed captions and transcriptions, and to access adequate closed captions and transcriptions on all audio and video content being accessed in ELC, high-fidelity prototypes were created for the two key stakeholders: instructors and students.</p>

    <p>&emsp;&emsp;It is important to note that visual content was taken directly from ELC for integration within each prototype. Use of such content constitutes fair use, and the Inclusive Dawgs' fair use statement can be accessed using the navigation bar at the top of this website, or through the following link: <a href = "FairUse.html">Fair Use Notice</a></p>
